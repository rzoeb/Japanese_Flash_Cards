    "### Japanese Language Flashcard Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview\n",
    "This notebook automates the creation of Japanese language Anki flashcards from textbook images. It combines OCR technology with large language model processing to extract, verify, and format vocabulary into ready-to-import flashcards.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Features\n",
    "- Extract Japanese text from textbook images using OCR API\n",
    "- Cross-reference extracted text with original images for accuracy\n",
    "- Generate structured CSV flashcards with proper formatting\n",
    "- Support for contextual vocabulary notes and usage examples\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Workflow\n",
    "1. **Image Upload**: Upload Japanese textbook page images\n",
    "2. **Text Extraction**: Use OCR API to extract text from the images\n",
    "3. **LLM Processing**: Send both the extracted text and original image to an LLM\n",
    "4. **Flashcard Generation**: Generate structured CSV data using specialized prompts from ```LLM_Prompts.py```\n",
    "5. **Export**: Save the resulting flashcards in Anki-compatible CSV format\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Flashcard Format\n",
    "The generated flashcards follow a specific CSV structure:\n",
    "- **Kanji column**: Contains the word in Kanji (or Hiragana/Katakana if no Kanji exists)\n",
    "- **Furigana column**: Contains the phonetic reading of the word in Hiragana\n",
    "- **English_Translation_and_Notes column**: Contains both the English translation and any usage or contextual notes\n",
    "\n",
    "Example output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"迷う [道に～]\",\"まよう [みちに～]\",\"lose one's way (e.g., get lost on the road)\"\n",
    "\"先輩\",\"せんぱい\",\"senior (student, colleague, etc.)\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits\n",
    "- **Accuracy**: Cross-references OCR text with the original image to fix errors\n",
    "- **Context-Aware**: Preserves usage examples and contextual information\n",
    "- **Time-Saving**: Automates the tedious process of manual flashcard creation\n",
    "- **Customizable**: Prompts can be adjusted for different textbook formats\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applications\n",
    "- Creating comprehensive JLPT study materials\n",
    "- Building personal vocabulary decks from textbooks\n",
    "- Supplementing classroom learning with digital flashcards\n",
    "- Archiving vocabulary from various Japanese learning resources"
